A simple Free TON external messages listener & DB logger.

We using this app in production to fetch every token history at waifuston.com. We store messages in blockchain via emitting events and to get these events we need some type of middleware. TON Watcher listens to events, decodes them, and stores them into a database. Then we can easily get events via HTTP API.

Based on TON SDK examples: https://github.com/tonlabs/sdk-samples/tree/master/low-level/node-js/core-api/listen-and-decode
